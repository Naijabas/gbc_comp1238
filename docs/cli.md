## `ls`

The `ls` command is used to list the contents of a directory. It displays files and subdirectories within the current working directory or a specified directory. Here are some common options:

- `ls -l`: Displays the contents in a detailed list format, including permissions, owner, group, size, and modification date.
- `ls -a`: Shows all files, including hidden files (those that start with a dot `.`).
- `ls -h`: Displays file sizes in a human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB).

```bash
ls -la
